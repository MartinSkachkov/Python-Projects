The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
All that glitters is not gold.
The early bird catches the worm.
Actions speak louder than words.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
Better late than never.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Birds of a feather flock together.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Practice makes perfect.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
A watched pot never boils.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
